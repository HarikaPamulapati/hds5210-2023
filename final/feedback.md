# Feedback on your final

**Final Score: 53/60**

The grading rubric for the final can be found in GitHub: https://github.com/paulboal/hds5210-2023/blob/main/final/final-instructions.pdf

**Functional Requirements**
* 5 points - Uses data from at least two different sources: local file, internet, web service, relational database, AWS S3, etc; and formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc
* 5 points - Data from multiple sources has to be joined together at least twice
* 5 points - Data is aggregated or pivoted at least twice during the program
* 5 points - Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times
* 5 points - The program creates 3 or more data visualizations 
* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.


**(-1) Generic variable names like `df1` or `df2` are not acceptable.  They make it hard for the reader to understand what is going on and what this variable refers to.**

**(-4) Your concatenations of data don't make sense logically.  These three data sets would need to summarized and the joined.**

**(-2) I see a couple of field level transformations, but not 5**

**Overall, your projct completed the requirements, but didn't really help us get any insights into the nature of the data or relationship between variables.  Still, your coding was strong.  Focus on understanding the data itself and the questions we're trying to answer.**
